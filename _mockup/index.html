                        <br/><br/>
                        <p>I am an italian girl, born and grown up in germany, enjoying the beauty of Zurich since 6 years.
                        I like food in all its facets and spending time with the most precious - my friends and loved family.</p>
                        <br/><br/>
                        <p><h2>Welcome to my Gluten Free Map of Zurich</h2></p>
                        <br/><br/>
                        <p><h3>Why did I decide to create this map and what is it all about?</h3></p>
                        <br/><br/>
                        <p>Due to a chronical autoimmune disease I needed to change my whole nurishment habits some years ago.<br/>
                        It was hard to learn what is safe food, to do the grocery and of course to say no to the food I was used to.<br/>
                        Explaining the whole story to family, friends and strangers is always difficult.</p>
                        <br/><br/>
                        <p>Eating out is all about explaining your issues and hoping to be understood and trust whatever happens in the kitchen.
                        I struggeled a lot with eating out. But now with years of experience, I gathered a lot of know how on where to eat safe.
                        So I wanted to share this know how with you, to give you a little peace of mind.</p>

                        <h4>Important:</h4> 
                        <p>Every location contains detailed information. When clicking on one of the pins on the map, the information appears on your screen.
                        Most of them I did personally visit, contain information on my personal experience and weather they have a special menue wit allergen declaration. In any case <b>do not forget</b> to inform the waiter about your food restrictions. 
                        <br/><br/></p>
                        <p></p><b>For coeliacs:</b> Please look at the flag "IG ZÃ¶liakie approved" and go to those restaurants as they can ensure that there is no contamination. In any case <b>do not forget</b> to always communicate your nutrition restrictions, allergies to the waiter.
                        <br/><br/></p>
                        <p></p>For other restaurants it is always helpful to have a multi language info card with you <a href="http://www.zoeliakie.ch/images/PDF/gastrokarten_A4.pdf" target="_blank">Download Infocard</a></p>
