                        <br/><br/>
                        <p>I am an italian girl, born and grown up in germany, enjoying the beauty of Zurich since 6 years.
                        I like food in all its facets and spending time with the most precious - my friends and loved family.</p>
                        
                        <p><h2>Welcome to my Gluten Free Map of Zurich</h2>
                        <br/><br/>
                        <h3>Why did I decide to create this map and what is it all about?</h3>
                        <br/>
                        Due to a chronical autoimmune disease I needed to change my whole nurishment habits some years ago.
                        It was hard to learn what is safe food, to do the grocery and of course to say no to the food I was used to.
                        Explaining the whole story to family, friends and strangers is always difficult.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Eating out is all about explaining your issues and hoping to be understood and trust whatever happens in the kitchen.
                        I struggeled a lot with eating out. But now with years of experience, I gathered a lot of know how on where to eat safe.
                        So I wanted to share this know how with you, to give you a little peace of mind.
                        <br/><br/>
                        <h4>Important:</h4> 
                        Every location contains detailed information. When clicking on one of the pins, the information appears on your screen.
                        Most of them I did personally visit, contain information on what I suggest and weather they have a special menue wit allergen declaration. In any case do not forget to inform the waiter about your food restrictions. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        <b>For coeliacs:</b> Please look at the flag "IG ZÃ¶liakie approved" and go to those restaurants as they can ensure that there is no contamination.
                        <br/><br/>
                        For other restaurants it is always helpful to have a multi language info card with you <a href="http://www.zoeliakie.ch/images/PDF/gastrokarten_A4.pdf" target="_blank">Download Infocard</a></p>
